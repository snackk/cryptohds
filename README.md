# cryptohds

## Overview

Before anything, the following requirements must be met:
* **mysql server** - Server must be up and running with username *root* and password *cryptohds*. Also create database named *cryptohds*.
* **maven** - Maven must be installed in order to run the App.
* **java 8** - Install java 8 or latest.
o* **IDE of your preference** - I prefer IntelliJ for Obvious reasons.

## Running

To run the App on the terminal do the following:
```sh
$ mvn clean install 
$ mvn spring-boot: run
```

On IntelliJ there's no need of maven vodu, it has a spring button to run.
